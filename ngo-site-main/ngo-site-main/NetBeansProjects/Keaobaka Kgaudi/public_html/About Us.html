                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    South Africa Student Financial Assistance(SASFA) aims to ensure students have opportunities to study
                    their
                    career choice they'd prefer in a tertairy institute of their choice.
                    We aim to help make South Africa a better country.
                    We want all our students to get a better education and we have seen how corruption has taken over by
                    force, we
                    aim to minimize that by providing students with other alternatives.

                    to
                    assist students with furthering their studies in Universities or Colleges of their choice. There
                    will be
                    many links available of different types of Bursaries like for instance student Loans, Nsfas and
                    scholarships
                    just to name a few. Every student will be able to access these links so that they are able to
                    request

                <h2>Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    We aim to send more students to tertiary level because according to the statistics, about 40% of
                    South
                    African
                    learners, dont reach tertiary level, they all end at matric.
                    We want to decrease the high rate of unemployment in this country by sending students to tertiary.
                    In the coming years we will also be posting learnerships from different companies, The future
                    belongs to
                    the
                    youth.

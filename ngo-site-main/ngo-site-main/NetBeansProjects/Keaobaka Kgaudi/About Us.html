            <h2>Financial Assistance for Students</h2>
            <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p> Financial assistance helps with providing bursary links that contain different bursaries that are able to assist students with furthering their studies in Universities or Colleges of their choice. There will be many links available of different types of Bursaries like for instance student Loans, Nsfas and scholarships just to name a few. Every student will be able to access these links so that they are able to request financial assistance to study in tertiary.
        <h2>Mission</h2>
        South Africa Student Financial Assistance(SASFA) aims to ensure students have opportunities to study their career choice they'd prefer in a tertairy institute of their choice. 
        We aim to help make South Africa a better country. 
        We want all our students to get a better education and we have seen how corruption has taken over by force, we aim to minimize that by providing students with other alternatives.
        
        <h1>Vision</h1>
        We aim to send more students to tertiary level because according to the statistics, about 40% of South African learners, dont reach tertiary level, they all end at matric.
        We want to decrease the high rate of unemployment in this country by sending students to tertiary.
        In the coming years we will also be posting learnerships from different companies, The future belongs to the youth.

        Every syudent deserves a better education and we aim to provide our students with that.
